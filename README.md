# Alice in Wonderland Google Doodle

My topic was “Alice in Wonderland,” but I also wanted to have the classic google design where it spells out “G O O G L E” in the features rather than just written over the top of a scene. So I decided to use some characters from Lewis Carroll’s classic story about Alice in Wonderland to spell out google over the top of a Wonderland-themed backdrop.
I accepted that my digital art skills are rather awful and need a lot of work, so apologies in advance for the characters looking awful... Also, it's hard to make small SVGs with Figma...
